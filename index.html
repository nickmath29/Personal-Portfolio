    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a senior at the University of Michigan pursuing a degree in Computer Science, with strong interests in cybersecurity, software development, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. 
        My academic foundation includes courses such as Intro to Cybersecurity, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Database Management Systems. 
        Professionally, I have worked as a Software Calibration Intern at Bosch, where I developed data analytics tools using Python and ETAS INCA/MDA to optimize calibration and reduce processing time for vehicle measurement data collected from embedded engine control units (ECUs). 
        I also have experience as a Software Quality Assurance Intern at Little Caesars and currently work part-time as a Quality Assurance Engineer. 
        I am eager to continue growing as an engineer and applying my skills to solve complex problems and create impactful solutions. <a href="../Personal-Portfolio/education.html">Learn More</a></p>
