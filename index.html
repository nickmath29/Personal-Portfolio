    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Motivated and detail-oriented student at the University of Michigan pursuing a degree in Computer Science, with strong interests in 
        cybersecurity, software development, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. 
        My academic foundation includes courses such as Intro to Cybersecurity, Intro to Artificial Intelligence, Networks, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Database Management Systems. 
        Professionally, I currently work as a Software Calibration Intern at Bosch, where I develop data analytics tools using 
        Python and ETAS INCA/MDA to optimize calibration and reduce processing time for vehicle measurement data collected from embedded engine control units (ECUs). 
        I also have experience as a Software Quality Assurance Intern at Little Caesars where I utilized Cypress, a JavaScript testing framework, to develop automated test scripts that ensured the functionality of our web and mobile apps. 
        I am eager to continue growing as an engineer and applying my skills to solve complex problems and create impactful solutions. <a href="../Personal-Portfolio/education.html">Learn More</a></p>
