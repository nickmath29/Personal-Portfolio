    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a junior at the University of Michigan, pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a focus on cybersecurity. 
        My academic foundation includes courses such as Intro to Cybersecurity, 
        Data Structures and Algorithms, and Database Management Systems.
        Professionally, I have experience as a Software Quality Assurance Intern at Little Caesars and currently work part-time as a Quality Assurance Engineer. 
        I am passionate about advancing my career in cybersecurity and am actively preparing for the 
        Security+ and Network+ certifications to deepen my expertise in network security and system defense.</p>
