                <p>"Motor vehicles must be safe and easy to use. 
                    Assessments are performed both in real vehicles and in driving simulators. 
                    However, many driving simulators are too expensive to purchase, 
                    too complex to use, take too long to program, and sometimes lack the desired functional characteristics. 
                    The goal of this project is to build an easy–to–use driving simulator platform through the creative use of free software (e.g., OpenDS, Roadrunner), 
                    simple hardware, and student creativity to develop a driving simulator suitable to support research on driver distraction, 
                    driver workload, and driver interfaces for partially–automated vehicles."</p>
